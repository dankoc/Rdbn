## Kaggle data description: 
##
## Classify handwritten digits in this "Getting Started" competition.
## 
## This competition is the first in a series of tutorial competitions designed to introduce 
## people to Machine Learning.
##
## The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine 
## what that digit is.  As the competition progresses, we will release tutorials which explain 
## different machine learning algorithms and help you to get started.
##
## The data for this competition were taken from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST ("Modified National 
## Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset is a classic within the Machine Learning 
## community that has been extensively studied.  More detail about the dataset, including Machine 
## Learning algorithms that have been tried on it and their levels of success, can be found at
